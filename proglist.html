        <h1>Command-line Program List</h1>
        <p>Enter one of the program numbers 
            shown in the command-line program box 
            on my home page and press Enter 
            (i.e to run program 1 on this list you would type
            <strong>1</strong> at the <strong>>> </strong> 
            prompt.)
        <p>Now the program you selected will run.
            Hopefully I've made then user friendly enough :).</p>
        <p>Each program has a number, a title, and a short description 
            of what the program does.</p>
